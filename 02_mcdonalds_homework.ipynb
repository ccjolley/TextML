    "McDonald's receives **thousands of customer comments** on their website per day, and many of them are negative. Their corporate employees don't have time to read every single comment, but they do want to read a subset of comments that they are most interested in. In particular, the media has recently portrayed their employees as being rude, and so they want to review any comments about **rude service** so that they can update their employee training accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "McDonald's has hired you to develop a system that ranks each comment by the **likelihood that it is referring to rude service**. They will use your system to build a \"rudeness dashboard\" for their corporate employees, so that employees can spend a few minutes each day examining the **most relevant recent comments**.\n",

    "Before hiring you, McDonald's used the [CrowdFlower platform](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone) to pay humans to **hand-annotate** about 1500 comments with the **type of complaint**. The complaint types are listed below, with the encoding used in the data listed in parentheses:\n",

There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.  Not going back if I can help it.   \n",

I needed to use the restroom  facilities  and the women's bathroom didn't have soap, the floor was wet,  the bathroom stink, and the toilets were nasty. This McDonald's is very nasty.   \n",

The store claimed to be 24 hours and the manager was standing right there doing paper work but would not help us. The cashier was only concerned with doing things for the drive thru and said that the manager said he wasn't allowed to help us. We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous. I think the manager should be fired.   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.   \n",
